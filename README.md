Health Monitoring &amp; Awareness Project for VIT Bhopal — focuses on smart health tracking, preventive measures, and tech-based wellness solutions. Built as part of academic learning and practical implementation.
Health & Habit Monitor

1. Introduction : - 
                  This project helps users keep track of their daily habits like water intake, exercise, study hours, and sleep. Many students and working people want to improve their                     lifestyle, but they forget their habits or cannot measure their improvement. So I created a simple Python-based habit tracker that stores daily information and shows                     how habits are improving.

2. Problem Statement : -
                      Most people start good habits but are unable to continue them because they don’t track their progress. Without daily monitoring, it becomes difficult to stay                             consistent. The aim of this project is to create a very simple and easy-to-use tool that helps users log their habits every day.

3. Objectives : -
                      To build a basic habit tracking system using Python.
                      To record daily habits such as water intake, exercise time, and sleep hours.
                      To show a summary of the data so users can see improvement.
                      To help users stay consistent by storing and reviewing habits.


4. Requirements  : -
                       Python installed on the system.
                       replit or any IDE (VS Code, Thonny, PyCharm).
                       Basic knowledge of Python lists, dictionaries, and file handling.


5. Project Design : -
                       The program takes user input for daily habits and saves them into a dictionary. The data is added to a list which stores multiple days. The user can enter data,                           view summary, or exit. The structure is simple so that beginners can understand the flow easily.

Top-Down Design : - 
                       Main menu
                       Input habits
                       Save habits
                       View summary
                       Exit


Algorithm : -          1. Start the program.
                       2. Show menu to user.
                       3. If user selects 'Add Habits':
                       Ask for water intake, sleep hours, exercise time.
                       Save the values into a dictionary.
                       Add dictionary to a list.
                       4. If user selects 'View Summary':
                       Show all stored records.
                       5. If user selects 'Exit':
                       Stop the program.




6. Testing : -
                       Entered sample values and checked if they store correctly.
                       Checked summary display for multiple days.
                       Tested wrong inputs like letters instead of numbers.
                       Verified program exits safely.


7. Results : - 

                     The program successfully saves and displays habit information. It is simple, clean, and works well for daily habit monitoring.

8. Conclusion : -
                      This project helped me understand how programming concepts can be used to solve daily life problems. By using basic Python structures like lists and dictionaries, I                       was able to create a working application that encourages users to build better habits. This can be extended in the future by adding graphs, notifications, or mobile                       app features.
